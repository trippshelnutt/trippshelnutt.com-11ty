<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I'm Tripp, a Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience programming in various languages, environments, and industries. Most of my experience is working on .NET projects using C# and JavaScript. Some modern, some legacy. Some large, some small.</p>

<p>I am a polyglot programmer and love learning new languages, tools, and paradigms. I've recently been learning more about other programming languages on the website <a href="https://exercism.org">Exercism</a>, which has many language tracks and programming exercises.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
