Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tripp, a Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience programming in various languages, environments, and industries. Most of my experience is working on .NET projects using C# and JavaScript. Some modern, some legacy. Some large, some small.

I am a polyglot programmer and love learning new languages, tools, and paradigms. I've recently been learning more about other programming languages on the website [Exercism](https://exercism.org), which has many language tracks and programming exercises.

Thanks for visiting!
