<h2>Uses</h2>
<section>
  <p>These are some of the tools that I use in my office. I have been working remotely since January 2018, and it's helpful to have a quality audio/video setup.</p>
</section>

<h2>Desktop</h2>
<section>
  <p>I use my desktop for PC gaming, so some of these items are better than needed for average remote work. I had trouble finding an NVIDIA 3 series until I won the NewEgg Shuffle.</p>

<h2>IDEs</h2>
<section>
  <p>I love VS Code as a lightweight editor, but I use Visual Studio for most of my work. I was hesitant for years to try ReSharper until I watched a friend using it in a legacy codebase, and I had to try it out. It makes refactoring tasks so much faster. I've had various C++ development jobs over the years, so I started using VIM long ago. When there is an option to install a VIM plugin, I will take that option. I'm not a VIM guru, but I know enough to be dangerous.</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>
<section>
  <p>I play electric bass as a hobby, so I have a little more than the average remote worker for an audio interface.</p>

<h2>Video</h2>
<section>
  <p>Pretty basic webcam. I've thought about upgrading to a DSLR with a capture card, but I don't do enough video work to justify the cost. This one gets me through most meetings.</p>

<h2>Desk</h2>
<section>
  <p>I've been using standing desks of some variety for over 10 years. I have used some that are fixed and do not allow automatic adjustment. I've had this desk for about four years, and I love it. I got the bamboo top but didn't get the wheels, and I somewhat regret that.</p>

<h2>Chair</h2>
<section>
  <p>I got so lucky when I found this chair at a thrift store for $40. This one has a mesh back and rollerblade wheels which I love way more than I thought I would.</p>
  <p>Update: I finally discovered why the chair was so cheap when it started sinking randomly. Shout out to <a href="https://www.crandalloffice.com/">Crandall Office Furniture</a> for a quick replacement part and very helpful instructional videos.</p>

<h2>Lights</h2>
<section>
  <p>I have been going a bit crazy over my office lighting. I have several light strips around my desk and my bookcase. LIFX controls have a lot of features, and my favorite feature is the schedule so that I can automatically dim the lights to remind me that it's time for bed.</p>
