<h2>Blog</h2>

<section>
  <p>I've started blogging on Hashnode recently. I've tried over the years to keep up with writing a blog, but I haven't been able to keep a good, consistent practice. Hashnode is a pretty easy setup to make the process easier. I really like that they back up content to a GitHub repository.</p>
